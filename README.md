## About The Game
In this game, you need to guess a number between 1 and 20.  
Each time you enter a number and press the **Check** button, the game tells you whether your guess is too high or too low.  
If you guess correctly, you win and the background turns green!  
If your score is higher than the previous highscore, it will update the record.  
You start with a score of 20, and each wrong guess reduces your score by 1.  
If your score reaches zero, you lose the game and the correct number is revealed.  
You can restart the game anytime by clicking the **Again!** button.
